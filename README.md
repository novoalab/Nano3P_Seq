# Nano3P-seq
Analysis of Nano3P-seq nanopore libraries (direct cDNA first strand sequencing with template switching)

## General command line steps used to analyze Nano3P-seq

### 1. Base-calling, demultiplexing, mapping
Base-calling and demultiplexing with Guppy:
```

```
Mapping with minimap2:
```

```

### 2. Filtering mapped reads based on annotations
```

```
### 3. Assigning reads to gene biotype
```

```
### 4. Assigning reads to transcripts/isoforms
```

```
### 5. Per-read poly(A) tail length estimations
```

```
### 6. Post-processing of polyA tail length estimations 
```

```
### 7. Analysis of tail composition
```

```
### 8. Visualizing the results

#### a) Scatterplots of poly(A) tail length estimations across biological replicates
```

```
#### b) Dotplots of poly(A) tail length estimations across time points 
```

```
#### c) Line plots of transcript abundances across time points
```

```
### 9. BONUS: Getting your poly(A) tail ends to be visible in IGV
