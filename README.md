# Nano3P-seq
Analysis of Nano3P-seq nanopore libraries (direct cDNA first strand sequencing with template switching)

## General command line steps used to analyze Nano3P-seq

### 1. Base-calling, demultiplexing, mapping
### 2. Filtering mapped reads based on annotations
### 3. Assigning reads to gene
### 4. Assigning reads to transcripts/isoforms
### 5. PolyA tail length estimations
### 6. Post-processing of polyA tail length estimations 
### 7. Analysis of tail composition
### 8. Visualizing the results
### 9. BONUS: Getting your poly(A) tail ends to be visible in IGV
